title: Haskell Weekly in 2017
---

Last year Haskell Weekly looked back on 2016 in [issue 35][1] by reviewing the
most popular links of the year. Earlier this year I reflected on [One year of
Haskell Weekly][2]. Now I want to combine those things. Here's a look back at
Haskell Weekly in 2017, including subscriber statistics, popular links, and the
first annual state of Haskell survey. (I compiled the information and graphs in
this post with [this Haskell script][3].)

In 2017 Haskell Weekly grew from a few hundred subscribers to over a couple
thousand! The first issue of 2017 reached 649 subscribers. The second to last
issue of 2017 went out to 1,990 subscribers. Today's issue, which is the last
one of 2017, is set to reach 2,017 subscribers. What a happy coincidence!

Going from 649 to 2,017 subscribers means that 1,368 people subscribed over the
course of the year. That's almost 4 new subscribers per day! A big spike
happened in the middle of May, but I don't remember if I caused that or it was
simply luck. It's interesting to note that the survey, which went out in early
November, did not cause that many new subscriptions.

As expected, the open rate continues to slowly trend down. It started the year
at almost 70% and ended a little about 50%.

The click rate varies much more than the open rate, but it also continues to
slowly trend down. It started the year around 35% and ended near 20%.

Haskell Weekly published the first annual state of Haskell survey in 2017. More
than 1,300 people filled it out! I won't re-summarize the results here, so if
you're interested please read the [2017 state of Haskell survey results][19].
