title: Haskell Weekly in 2017
---

last year at the end of the year haskell weekly reviewed the most popular links of the year
[Issue 35][]
earlier this year i reviewed the first year of running haskell weekly
[One year of Haskell Weekly][]
now at the end of the year i want to combine those things
so here's a look back at haskell weekly in 2017

published first state of haskell survey
filled out by 1,335 people
[2017 state of Haskell survey results][]

issue 36 on january 4 2017 went out to 649 subscribers
issue 86 on december 21 2017 went out to 1990 subscribers
issue 87 will be the first to go out to over 2000 subscribers
not free anymore :)

![total subscribers][]

1341 new subscribers over the course of the year
that's almost 4 per day!
something big happened in may around issues 55 and 56
i don't remember what it was though
interesting to note that the survey didn't increase the subscription rate

![new subscribers][]

open rate continues to slowly trend downward
as expected
still very good at over 50%

![open rate][]

click rate varies a lot
but also slowly trending down
still very good at over 20%
