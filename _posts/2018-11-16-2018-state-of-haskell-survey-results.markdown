title: 2018 state of Haskell survey results
---

The [2018 state of Haskell survey][1] opened at the start of November and closed a couple days ago.
It was the second annual state of Haskell survey.
The survey was co-sponsed by Haskell Weekly and Haskell.org.

Last year the [2017 state of Haskell survey][2] received 1,335 responses.
This year we received almost four times as many.
An astonishing 5,094 responses were submitted!
To everyone that participated in the survey:
Thank you!
You feedback is hugely valuable.

This post will graph the responses to the multiple-choice questions.
I will not attempt to summarize the responses free-response questions.
I encourage any interested parties to download the raw results, do their own analysis, and share the results.
You can download the anonymized responses as a [CSV][3], which is licensed under the [ODbL 1.0 license][4].
